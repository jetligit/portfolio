        This was a personal project I decided to do because I gained the skills necessary to make a full stack application and I thought
        it would be cool to have an app that tells you all of the places you have been. I then came up with the idea to use the EXIF
        metadata from uploaded images and Google Maps API to display markers at the locations in which the pictures were taken. This way, 
        users can visualize all of the locations they have been to look back on and perhaps even to return to.

        In the first part of the project, I worked on basic functionality for the project. I first imported Google Maps API and then
        made an input button to upload images. I sent the images' data to the backend, extracted the EXIF metadata, and then 
        sent the GPS coordinates back to the frontend so the markers can be displayed. I uploaded two images, one from New York City's
        Korea Town and one from my parents' vacation in Norway, and in the image above, the markers are displayed in the corresponding
        locations.

    <h1 class = "phase" > Part Two: </h1>
    <div>
        <img class = "date" src = "date.png" alt = "Date Display with Manhattan Marker">
    </div>
    <p class = "er_diagram"> 
        In the second part of the project, since the basic functionalities were finished, I thought about adding extra functionalities
        that would enhance the user experience. I decided to add a clear button to delete all of the markers that are currently displayed.
        In addition, I added an info window that displays when each marker is clicked, and shows the date in which the picture was
        taken.
