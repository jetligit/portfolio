        This was a project done in a team of four. This is a video game database project is a PostgreSQL-backed command line interface 
        application. We used a relational database to store information about video games and users. Using the command line, users are 
        able to create an account, login, play games, search for games, create and edit their collections of video games, rate games, 
        get game recommendations, get the top 20 most popular games, and more. When users enter in information or run commands, SQL 
        prepared statements are executed and the relevant information in the database is returned or stored.

        We first had to make a plan for the project. We designed an Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram to desribe how each entity in 
        the project relates to one another. Then we reduced this ER diagram into tables to help us plan what to put in the 
        database. Finally, we laid out some constraints for our data.

        With our planning finished, we then moved on to the database and application side of things. We generated user and video 
        game data using ChatGPT and populated our database tables with it. Then, we used Java and SQL to create the command line 
        interface and implement most of the required functionalities including collection creation, playing, making accounts and 
        logging in.

    <h1 class = "phase" > Phase Three: </h1>
    <div>
        <img class = "database" src = "data_poster.png" alt = "Data Analysis Poster">
    </div>
    <p class = "er_diagram"> 
        We finished implementing the rest of the functionalities and ensured everything was working properly with in depth testing. 
        Then, we performed data analysis on our data using code and graphs in Excel to find trends. Finally, we displayed the results
        from our data analysis to create our poster.
