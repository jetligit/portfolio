    <h1> Video Game Database Project </h1>

        <p> This was a project done in a team of four. This is a video game database project is a PostgreSQL-backed command line interface 
            application. We used a relational database to store information about video games and users. Using the command line, users are 
            able to create an account, login, play games, search for games, create and edit their collections of video games, rate games, 
            get game recommendations, get the top 20 most popular games, and more. 
        </p>

    <h2> How it works: </h2>
    <p> When users enter in information or run commands, SQL prepared statements are executed and the relevant information in the 
        database is returned or stored.  
    </p>

    <h2> The process: </h2>
    <h3> Phase 1: </h3>
    <p> 
        We first had make a plan for the project. We designed an Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram to desribe how each entity in the
        project relates to one another. Then we reduced this ER diagram into tables to help us plan what to put in the database. 
        Finally, we laid out some constraints for our data. 
    </p>
    <h3> Phase 2: </h3>
    <p> 
        With our planning finished, we then moved on to the database and application side of things. We generated user and video game
        data using ChatGPT and populated our database tables with it. Then, we used Java and SQL to create the command line interface 
        and implement most of the required functionalities including collection creation, playing, making accounts and loggin in. 
    </p>
    <h3> Phase 3: </h3>
    <p> 
        We finished implementing the rest of the functionalities and ensured everything was working properly with in depth testing. 
        Then, we performed data analysis on our data using code and graphs in Excel to find trends. Finally, we used the results
        from our data analysis to create our poster.
