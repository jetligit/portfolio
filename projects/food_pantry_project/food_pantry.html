        This was a project done in a team of four. This is a full stack application that models a food pantry with users and an admin.
        The following images and details will show how our application has developed over 4 sprints.

        We first had to make a plan for the project. We designed a Domain Analysis Diagram to set up the logic behind our application.
        When that was completed, we started working on the backend of our project. We wrote the functions for an admin to be able to 
        add, delete, or update food items in the inventory. We then tested these functions using curl commands.

    <h1 class = "phase" > Sprint Two: </h1>
    <div class = "pages">
        <div class = page-card>
            <h2> Admin Page </h2>
            <img class = "database" src = "Sprint2/sprint2_admin.png" alt = "Sprint 2 Admin Page">
        </div>

        <div class = page-card>
            <h2> User Page </h2>
            <img class = "database" src = "Sprint2/sprint2_user.png" alt = "Sprint 2 User Page">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p class = "sprinttwo"> 
        In this sprint, we started working on our user interface and continued working on functionality. We first made a basic login page
        that sends the user into the admin page or their own user page, depending on the credentials. Then, we made an admin page with 
        admin add, delete, and update buttons. Next, we developed the functionality needed for the user to add or delete food items from
        their basket and for the user to search for food items by name, and we made buttons for these. We also created a search bar that
        returns the name of the food item that contains the search string.

    <h1 class = "phase" > Sprint Three: </h1>
    <div class = page-card>
        <h2> Login Page </h2>
        <img class = "database" src = "Sprint3/sprint3_login.png" alt = "Sprint 3 Login Page">
    </div>

    <div class = "pages">
        <div class = page-card>
            <h2> Admin Page </h2>
            <img class = "database" src = "Sprint3/sprint3_admin.png" alt = "Sprint 3 Admin Page">
        </div>

        <div class = page-card>
            <h2> User Page </h2>
            <img class = "database" src = "Sprint3/sprint3_user.png" alt = "Sprint 3 User Page">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p class = "sprinttwo"> 
        In this sprint, we finished up our project. We added a checkout button which lets the user check out their items, thereby
        removing the items from their basket and from the inventory respectively. We also implemented our bonus functionalities, which 
        were a donation bank and a total contribution ranking system. We liked the idea of a donation bank because it would enable users
        to donate money directly rather than donating a specific food item. Then, for our ranking system we labeled as top contributors, 
        we kept track of the total contributions of each user, which includes the total amount of money they donated by buying food items 
        and donating through the donation bank. Then, on every user page, the usernames of the top three donators would be displayed. We 
        felt this would incentivize users to donate more and make those who have donated a large amount feel appreciated for their 
        generosity. Then, with all of the functionalities finished, we improved our user interface. We added vibrant colors, changed
        button sizing, and added an image to the login page.
