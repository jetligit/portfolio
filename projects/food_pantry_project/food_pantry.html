        This was a project done in a team of four. This is a full stack application that models a food pantry with users and an admin.
        The following images and details will show how our application has developed over  sprints.

    <p class = "sprintone"> 
        We first had to make a plan for the project. We designed a Domain Analysis Diagram to set up the logic behind our application.
        When that was completed, we started working on the backend of our project. We wrote the functions for an admin to be able to 
        add, delete, or update food items in the inventory. We then tested these functions using curl commands.

            <p class = "sprinttwo_admin"> In this sprint, we started working on the user interface and continued creating functionality. 
                We first made a basic login page that sends the user into the admin page or their own user page. Then, we made an admin 
                page with add, delete, and update buttons to change the inventory. 
            </p>

            <p class = "sprinttwo_user"> Next, we created a user page where the food items are displayed. We then created buttons for the user to add or delete 
                food items from their basket. We also created a search bar to enable the user to search for food items by name.

            improved our user interface. We added vibrant colors, changed button sizing, and added an image to the login page. In our 
            admin page, we improved the user interface and kept the functionalities the same.

                    <p class="sprintthree_user">
                        In our user page, we added a checkout button which lets the user check out their items, thereby
                        removing the items from their basket and from the inventory respectively. We also implemented 2 bonus functionalities: 
                        a donation bank and a total contribution ranking system.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sprintthree_user">
                        We made the donation bank because it would enable users to donate 
                        money directly rather than donating a specific food item. 
                    </p>
                    <p class = "sprintthree_user">
                        Then, for our ranking system, we kept track of the total 
                        contributions of each user, including the total contributions through buying food items and donating to the donation bank,
                        and displayed the usernames of the top three donators on every user page. We wanted to incentivize users to donate 
                        more while also showing appreciation for those who have donated a significant amount.
