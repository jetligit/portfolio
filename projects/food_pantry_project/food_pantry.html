        This was a project done in a team of four. This is a full stack application that models a food pantry with users and an admin.
        The following images and details will show how our application has developed over 4 sprints.

        We first had to make a plan for the project. We designed a Domain Analysis Diagram to set up the logic behind our application.
        When that was completed, we started working on the backend of our project. We wrote the functions for an admin to be able to 
        add, delete, or update food items in the inventory. We then tested these functions using curl commands.

    <h1 class = "phase" > Sprint Two: </h1>
    <div class = "pages">
        <img class = "database" src = "Sprint2/sprint2_admin.png" alt = "Sprint 2 Admin Page">
        <img class = "database" src = "Sprint2/sprint2_user.png" alt = "Sprint 2 User Page">
    </div>
    <p class = "sprinttwo"> 
        In this sprint, we started working on our user interface and continued working on functionality. We first made a basic login page
        that sends the user into the admin page or their own user page, depending on the credentials. Then, we made an admin page with 
        admin add, delete, and update buttons. Next, we developed the functionality needed for the user to add or delete food items from
        their basket and for the user to search for food items by name, and we made buttons for these. 

    <h1 class = "phase" > Sprint Three: </h1>
    <div>
        <img class = "database" src = "" alt = "Data Analysis Poster">
    </div>
    <p class = "er_diagram"> 
        We finished implementing the rest of the functionalities and ensured everything was working properly with in depth testing. 
        Then, we performed data analysis on our data using code and graphs in Excel to find trends. Finally, we displayed the results
        from our data analysis to create our poster.
